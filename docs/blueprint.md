## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep space background gradient from #0A0A1A to #1A1A3A to establish a futuristic and immersive atmosphere. The color choice is aligned with a modern technology company.
- Accent color: Electric cyan (#00F0FF) as the main accent to inject a lively, cutting-edge energy to interactive elements. As the user's focus should remain on key areas, contrast must be assured and a vibrant color should do the trick.
- Background color: Glassmorphism elements with rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) and backdrop-filter: blur(10px) for a frosted glass effect.
- Headings: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) with increased letter-spacing to establish a computerized and techy aesthetic, appropriate to Euro IT Technology.
- Body: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for optimal readability, offering a clean, neutral and objective look to ensure clear communication. As such, Inter's features are the ideal choice for body.
- CSS for all transitions. The transition should have subtle micro-interactions on all interactive elements and page transition effects between sections. Ensure 60fps.
- Responsive grid system. All content must reflow in response to width changes and offer an ideal experience on any screen size.
